As global awareness of environmental issues continues to rise, property developers increasingly market their projects with "green" credentials. But how often do these eco-friendly claims match reality on the ground?

## About This Journal

This academic paper provides a critical examination of **greenwashing practices** in the property development industry, focusing on:

- **Green Signaling** — how environmental attributes are used as marketing tools to suggest product quality
- **Institutional Decoupling** — the disconnect between stated policies and actual practices
- **Functional Decoupling** — the gap between marketing brochures and real conditions (e.g., eco-parks, flood-free guarantees)
- **Regulatory Implications** — the global crackdown on corporate greenwashing

## Key Insights

The paper argues that the phenomenon of institutional decoupling in eco-city developments represents a critical breach of consumer trust. As environmental claims become increasingly central to property marketing, the need for robust legal frameworks to address misleading green claims has never been more urgent.

This socio-legal analysis offers valuable insights for regulators, legal practitioners, and consumers seeking to navigate the complex landscape of environmental marketing claims.
