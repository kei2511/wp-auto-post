The accepted history of philosophy often credits Thales of Miletus (c. 600 BCE) as the father of rational thought. However, this groundbreaking journal by **Dr. Bahori Ahoen ME., MH.** challenges this Eurocentric narrative, positioning Prophet Abraham (c. 2000 BCE) as the true pioneer of cosmological philosophy. Abraham didn't just receive revelation; he employed rigorous empirical observation and logical deduction to deconstruct the astral theology of Mesopotamia, 1,400 years before the Greek "miracle".

## About This Journal

This study synthesizes archaeological evidence from Ur with theological hermeneutics to reveal Abraham's intellectual methodology:

- **Deconstructing Eurocentrism**: The paper argues that rational inquiry and the rejection of mythos began in the Ancient Near East, not Greece.
- **The First Cosmological Argument**: Abraham observed the transient nature of celestial bodies (stars, moon, sun) — noting they rise and set (*afala*) — to logically deduce that they cannot be divine. He formulated the necessity of a Transcendent, Unmoved Mover or First Cause.
- **Reductio ad Absurdum**: In his debate with King Nimrod, Abraham used advanced dialectics to expose the logical fallacies of tyranny and astral worship, effectively paralyzing the tyrant's logic.
- **Empirical Monotheism**: Faith in One God (*Tauhid*) is presented not as dogmatic acceptance, but as the inevitable conclusion of critical thinking and observation.

## Why It Matters

This research redefines the origins of philosophy, bridging the gap between faith and reason. It repositions Islamic theology as inherently rational and scientific, countering Orientalist tropes that view religious faith as antithetical to reason. By recognizing Abraham as a philosopher, we find a shared intellectual heritage for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
