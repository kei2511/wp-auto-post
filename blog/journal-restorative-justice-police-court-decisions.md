Indonesia's criminal justice system is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift. Moving away from the retributive approach that emphasizes punishment, the concept of **restorative justice** is gaining traction—one that prioritizes the restoration of relationships between offenders, victims, and the community.

## About This Journal

This academic paper, authored by **Dr. Bahori Ahoen, S.H., S.E., M.H., M.E.** from the Bahori Ahoen Institute in Jakarta, provides an in-depth examination of:

- **The crisis of retributive approaches** in Indonesia's criminal justice system
- **The rise of restorative justice** as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism
- **The transformation mechanism** of police-level peace agreements into legally binding court decisions
- **The principle of *ultimum remedium*** — criminal law as the last resort

## Why This Matters

The restorative justice approach offers a more humane and effective solution for various minor criminal offenses. Peaceful settlements between offenders and victims can produce better outcomes compared to lengthy and costly conventional judicial processes.

This paper provides a comprehensive legal framework for understanding how police-mediated peace agreements can be transformed into enforceable court decisions with permanent legal force.
