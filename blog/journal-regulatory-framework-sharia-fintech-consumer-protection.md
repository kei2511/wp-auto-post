The rapid growth of Sharia-compliant fintech in the post-pandemic era has brought both innovation and significant risks. The massive fraud case of **PT DSI** in early 2026, which caused a loss of **IDR 2.4 trillion** to over **15,000 investors**, exposed critical vulnerabilities in the current regulatory landscape of Sharia P2P Lending.

## About This Journal

This critical analysis by **Dr. Bahori Ahoen, M.E., M.H.** (Dosen Hukum Ekonomi Syariah, Universitas Tazkia) performs a legal autopsy on the PT DSI scandal. It investigates how a "Sharia" labeled platform could execute a systemic Ponzi scheme despite existing regulations (POJK No. 10/2022).

Key focus areas include:
- **The "Halal Halo Effect":** How psychological bias towards religious labeling caused investors to overlook due diligence.
- **Regulatory Loopholes:** The absence of mandatory "Independent Trustee" mechanisms and direct asset collateralization.
- **Systemic Fraud Anatomy:** How PT DSI manipulated project data and used new investor funds to pay old returns.

## The Proposed Solution: ICMS (Integrated Collateral Management System)

To restore trust in the Islamic digital economy, the journal proposes a **Zero Trust Architecture** implemented through an **Integrated Collateral Management System (ICMS)**. This system relies on a "Triple-Lock" mechanism:

1.  **Independent Trustee (Wali Amanat):** Removing control of funds from the fintech platform. Funds are held by a third-party Sharia Bank and only disbursed upon verified project milestones.
2.  **Digital Mortgage Rights (Hak Tanggungan Digital):** Automatic locking of collateral assets integrated with the National Land Agency (BPN) to prevent double-pledging or asset stripping.
3.  **Smart Contract Execution:** Automated disbursement based on physical progress verification, ensuring funds are used strictly for the intended project.

## Policy Recommendations

The paper urges immediate regulatory reforms:
- **OJK:** Mandate the use of Trustees and automatic collateral registration for all P2P lending.
- **Cross-Agency Integration:** Collaboration between OJK, BPN, and the Ministry of Law to create a tamper-proof Digital Collateral protocol.
- **Investor Protection Fund:** Establishment of a specialized guarantee fund for Sharia fintech to mitigate systemic fraud risks.

## Why It Matters

As Indonesia aims to become a global hub for Islamic Finance, the integrity of its fintech ecosystem is paramount. This journal argues that moral promises are insufficient; the industry needs a framework where Sharia compliance is enforced by unalterable code and strict legal structures.
