The annual uncertainty surrounding the Islamic calendar is not just a religious ritual issue; it is a legal anomaly hindering modern civilization. In this article, **Dr. Bahori Ahoen, M.H., M.E.** argues for the urgent transition from traditional *Rukyatul Hilal* (subjective visual moon sighting) to a **Global Hijri Calendar (KHGT)** based on objective scientific calculation (*Hisab*).

## About This Journal

This interdisciplinary study connects Islamic law (*Ushul Fiqh*), modern astronomy, and economic analysis to advocate for a rigorous timekeeping system:

- **Legal Certainty vs. Ambiguity**: Subjective sighting leads to legal and economic uncertainty (e.g., for contract maturity dates). A unified calendar provides the objective certainty required for modern governance and commerce.
- **Scientific Validation**: Modern astronomical calculation is as precise as eclipse predictions. Rejecting certain scientific data (*yaqin*) for doubtful visual reports (*syakk*) contradicts the fundamental Fiqh principle: *"Certainty cannot be removed by doubt."*
- **Comparative Analysis**: The paper compares MABIMS (regional), Ummul Qura (local), and KHGT (global/Turkey-Muhammadiyah) models, advocating for the latter as the most rational solution that unifies the Muslim world.
- **Unified Ummah**: A single calendar unifies the Muslim world's rhythm of worship (e.g., Arafah Day) and strengthens political stability by removing subjective disputes.

## Why It Matters

Adopting a global calendar is presented as a form of technological *Ijtihad*. It is essential for restoring dignity, order, and progress in the digital era, ensuring that Islamic timekeeping is predictive, objective, and unified.
