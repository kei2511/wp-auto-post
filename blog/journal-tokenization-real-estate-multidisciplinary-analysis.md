The digital transformation of real estate is no longer theoretical. With the graduation of PT Teknologi Gotong Royong (GORO) from Indonesia's OJK Regulatory Sandbox in November 2025, micro-investments in property starting at just IDR 10,000 have become a reality. Yet behind this innovation lies a significant **regulatory vacuum** at the intersection of digital financial assets and conventional agrarian law.

## About This Journal

This academic paper by **Dr. Bahori Ahoen, M.E., M.H.** provides a comprehensive multidisciplinary analysis of blockchain-based property tokenization in Indonesia, focusing on:

- **The Agrarian Regulatory Gap** — Indonesia's Basic Agrarian Law (UUPA No. 5/1960) does not recognize digital tokens as valid *in rem* rights (hak kebendaan), creating legal uncertainty for investors
- **The Tax Efficiency Crisis** — the existing tax regime, designed for high-value singular transactions, faces a systemic "efficiency crisis" when applied to thousands of high-frequency micro-transactions
- **The GORO Case Study** — an analysis of the first platform to graduate from OJK's Regulatory Sandbox for property tokenization
- **POJK No. 3/2024** — an evaluation of the compatibility between digital finance regulations and land law

## The Proposed Hybrid Legal-Fiscal Model

The key novelty of this research is a **Hybrid Legal-Fiscal Model** built on three pillars:

1. **Collective PPJB (Binding Sale and Purchase Agreements)** — digitized via UU ITE to bridge the gap between digital tokens and legal land titles. The platform maintains a real-time ledger of fractional owners legally linked to a single notarized master document.

2. **Mandatory Mortgage Rights (Hak Tanggungan)** — an innovative application of Hak Tanggungan to digital assets under Article 3 of UUHT. This elevates retail investors to the status of *Separated Creditors (Kreditur Separatis)*, providing a safety net in case of platform insolvency.

3. **Aggregated Tax Consolidation** — the platform acts as a Withholding Agent (WAPU), accumulating tax portions in a digital vault. The full tax payment (PPh & BPHTB) is triggered only during the final Transfer of Title (AJB).

## Policy Recommendations

The journal also presents concrete policy recommendations:

- **To the Ministry of ATR/BPN:** Establish a "Digital Land Book Annex" for collective fractional interests
- **To OJK:** Mandate Mortgage Rights (HT) for all RWA platforms post-sandbox
- **To DJP:** Create a specific tax code for "Fractional Property Assets" for consolidated reporting

## Why It Matters

As Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates globally, Indonesia needs a legal framework that protects retail investors without stifling technological innovation. This journal provides a comprehensive roadmap for harmonizing agrarian law, financial regulation, and fiscal policy into a cohesive, forward-looking framework.
